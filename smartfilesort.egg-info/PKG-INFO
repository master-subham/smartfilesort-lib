# smartfilesort

**smartfilesort** is an AI-powered file organizer that automatically sorts, renames, and organizes your files based on type, size, and creation date.

- **Size-Based Sorting:** Separates files into large, medium, and small categories.
- **Date-Based Organization:** Groups files by creation date.
- **AI-Based Auto-Rename:** Uses NLP (via spaCy) to intelligently rename files based on their content.
- **Manual File Move:** Easily move files to custom folders.
- **Clean Empty Folders:** Automatically removes empty folders after organizing.
